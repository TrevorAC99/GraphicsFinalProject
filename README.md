# GraphicsFinalProject
This is final project that David Bain (https://github.com/baind06) and I (Trevor Carlson, https://github.com/TrevorAC99) made for the computer graphics class we took at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. None of David's commits show up in this repo because I had to resurrect this project from a backup I made of the the original project.
